// The types defined in this file are a representation of the CMSIS "System View
// Description" implemented in Swift.

// See https://www.keil.com/pack/doc/CMSIS/SVD/html/index.html
//
// The Swift implementation leaves out various details, like arrays of
// registers, which are not used in the RP2040 SVD file. It also presents a
// flattened view where references and default values are already resolved.

// The Swift implementation was derived from [SVD Schema File v1.3.9](https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS_5/blob/develop/CMSIS/Utilities/CMSIS-SVD.xsd)
